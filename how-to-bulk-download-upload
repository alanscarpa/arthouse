- Get CSV from fiverr
- Download all images from image column to a folder
- Run "Crop it" on all images in photoshop and save to separate, edited folder
- Remove all instances of "posters copy.jpg" and replace with "poster.jpg" in filenames in edited folder - ACTUALLY, CHANGEE TO posters.jpg 
- In CSV, make new column, FIREBASE-STORAGE-URL column with and replace "posters" below with whatever the category is:
	="gs://arthouse-571c6.appspot.com/art-images/posters/" & SUBSTITUTE((LOWER(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(RIGHT(REGEXEXTRACT(B2, "~\/.*\.jpg"),LEN(REGEXEXTRACT(B2, "~\/.*\.jpg"))-2)," ","-"),"--",""))), "posters.jpg", "poster.jpg")
		- IF YOU RENAME FILES TO plural POSTERS.jpg THEN YOU DONT NEED THE OUTERMOST SUBSTITUTE, THIS WAS A MESS UP
- In CSV, find and replace size to numberXnumber
- In CSV, format price to number to remove $
- Export spreadsheet and create a JSON file with:
