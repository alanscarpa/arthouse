<b>Ever wondered how art would look on your wall before you buy it?</b>
<br><br>
Arthouse uses the latest in <i>augmented reality</i> to give you an accurate preview of the look and size on your wall.
<br><br>
Using the app is as simple as 1, 2, see.
<br>
1 - Choose an item from our collection of over 1,000 pieces.
<br>
2 - Stand 3 feet from your wall.
<br>
3 - Tap a spot on your wall to see how it looks!
<br><br>

Then you can simply drag your finger to move the artwork anywhere you want. You can also change the size with a tap of a button. 
<br><br>

Shopping for wall decor has never been so fun, easy, and accurate!
<br><br>

Stop buying art online sight unseen. We take the guess work out of online wall decor shopping.
